| C1  | We can only tell the proportion for the individual country in a stacked bar chart but hard to do a comparison with other countries as there are 5 types of responses. This is especially so when the stacked bar chart is sorted alphabetically and the colours are not aligned. Used of random colours make it harder to see the positive and negative responses                                        |  To use Diverging Stacked Bar Chart with Neutral in middle, displaying half negative and half positive to better compare the negatives and positives percentages.

* The title "Understand the public willingness on Covid-19 vaccination" states clearly the objective of the Data visualization. Ability to select the questions allows user to have see each questions and their responses. This is further value add by having the flexibility to select by overall or country, and breakdown by demographic with ad-hoc parameters.

* For the Error bar Dot plot, we can select by the different response types and combination of Confidence intervals. The Chart title will be dynamically change to reflect the selections supplement with tooltip for details.
* Both charts are interactive linked to enable cross highlight such as by country or demographic. 
* Filtering on the right panel allows narrowing down to country selections and the dynamic demographic categories.

# 4.0 Major observations 

**1)** Japanese are the most worried about getting COVID-19 with the highest Agree and Strongly Agree (67%), followed by Spanish and South Korean at 64% and 58% respectively.
On other hand, Australians and Netherlanders (Dutch) are the least worried about getting COVID-19 at 36%, and 32% agreeing with the statement.


![](picture/33.png)


**2)** French shows the highest negative and lowest positive in believing their government will provide them with an effective vaccine.
while Danish(Denmark) and British(UK) have the highest trust in their government at 68% and 64% positive (Strongly Agree and Agree). Although Israel has a higher positive than Singapore(61%), it has more uncertainty with a larger 99% Confidence interval from 58% to 69% due to a smaller sample size of 503 responses.  Singapore has the least negative(Strongly Disagree and Disagree) proportion at 10%.

![](picture/34.png)

Japan is the 2nd lowest positive(45%) but mainly due to the highest neutrality of 40% proportion to government health authorities providing effective COVID-19 vaccine. 
![](picture/35.png)
**3)** Across all countries, Females are generally more worried about getting COVID-19 except for Singapore and Australia where Males are marginally equal or more worried about getting the virus.

![](picture/36.png)

**4)** On the country level, Japan, Singapore, France, and Spain are the top countries worried about the vaccination side effects.

![](picture/37.png)

**5)** We can observe that older people are more worried about getting COVID-19. 
![](picture/38.png)

While middle age followed by young adults are more worried about vaccine side effects. Age group 90-99 shows large CI due to lower sample size of 26 responses. 

![](picture/39.png)

Similarly, retirees have the highest positive response when asked to get COVID-19 vaccine questions by this week, year and if they never get it, they will regret it.

![](picture/40.png)

Retirees are also one of the least worried about the potential side effect. 

![](picture/41.png)

This may be due to the elderly which are mainly retirees are more vulnerable and have complications due to existing health conditions compared to the younger generation. [(WHO , APR 2020)](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-delivers-advice-and-support-for-older-people-during-covid-19#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic,potential%20underlying%20health%20conditions) and thus more keen on getting the vaccine.

**6)** Smaller Household sizes (1-2) were observed to be more positive in getting vaccine consistency across the getting COVID-19 vaccine questions.
