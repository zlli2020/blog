## 1.1 Clarity

| S/N | Critiques                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Suggestions                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1   | The summary write-up described the increase in the proportion of labour force using age group of 55 & over and 25 to 54.  However, the age group for the graph is using an interval of 5. Thus, making it hard to link the lead in with the graph. | To use a consistent interval of age groups in both graph and text. The lead-in write up will summarize the data visualization as Dashboard title                                                       |
| 2   | The title “Resident labour force by age - Per Cent” did not effectively communicate clearly if the measure used is by percentage proportion breakdown, participation rate, or difference in percentage change over the years.                      | To reflect the measuring unit LFPR and the comparison between 2009 and 2019.Chart title will explicitly state the measure and breakdown as “Percentage change in LFPR by Age Group - 2009 versus 2019” |
| 3   | The line chart does not have an explicit Y-axis scale. Without the Y-axis, the figures cannot be ascertained and the measure is not clear.The X-axis can also be clearer with Age group label.                                                   | Add explicit Y-axis scale and label and X-Axis label in chart title for better clarity.                                                                                                                |
| 4   | Having only a snapshot comparing 2009 and 2019 can be misleading. We do not know if the changes are consistent between 2009 to 2019.                                                                                                               | Add sparklines to show a quick trend of each age group category.                                                                                                                                       |
| 5   | The line graph may not be effectively used for the categorical data. It may unintendedly emphasize the change between the age groups instead of the comparison of the two years.                                                                   | Replace with categorial charts using an arrow chart(similar effect as a bar chart highlighting the differences) to emphasize the change in 2009 and 2019.                                              |
| 6   | The median age reference line is misleading as the X-axis point is used as the actual age mark in the graph                                                                                                                                        | To remove median age and reference line from the chart.                                                                                                                                                |                                   |

| 1   | The graph shows the redundant year 2009 and 2019 three times. These unnecessary non-data-inks add distraction to the graph.            | Reduce the number of year labels appropriately.                                                                 |
| 2   | No contrasting colors for comparison. The color grey and blue are similar and dull and could be hard for viewers with color blindness. | Use contrasting color-blind friendly colors such as red and blue colors to highlight differences appropriately. |
| 3   | Non-data-ink such as the dark color table and bolding of the X-axis divert focus away from the line chart.                             | Remove dark color table and un-bold axis label.                                                                 |
| 4   | Too much different information in a single chart diverts the key points.                                                               | Remove unnecessary chart objects                                                                                |



# 2.0 Sketch of Proposed Design







# 3.0 Data Visualization Step-by-step guide

## 3.1 Data preparation

### 3.1.1 Pre-import data prep
Copy the data from Excel **sheet “T5_T” in mrsd_2019LabourForce_T5.xlsx** into the **new sheet Data**.  Remove the empty columns and format the records as shown.<img src="picture/1.png" />

### 3.1.1 Import data into Tableau 
i)	Import **sheet “Data”** from Excel into Tableau.
ii)	Set **field names are in first row.** 
iii)	Select column **2009** to **2019** and right click set pivot.

### 3.1.2 Rename pivoted columns
i)	Rename column **Pivot Field Names** to **Year**
ii)	Rename column **Pivot Field Values** to **LFPR %**
iii)	Format **Year** as date  

## 3.2 Create Arrow Chart

### 3.2.1 Drag and drop the dimensions and measure
i)	Drag **Age group** to Columns
ii)	Drag **Year** to Filters, select only **2009** and **2019**.
iii)	Drag **LFPR %** to Rows



iv)	Set *Marks* as line chart
v)	Drag *Year* to Path 
### 3.2.2 Create Calculated Fields
i)	**Analysis -> Create Calculated Fields -> Direction**.
This is to get the difference of LFPR % of 2019 – 2009 to set the color and shape of the arrow chart. Click on *Default Table Calculation* to set the definition **compute as Year** and **At the level year of year**

ii)	Create new Calculated Field, *Shape*

### 3.2.3 Create Shape and dual axis

i)	Drag **LFPR %* *to Rows again
ii)	Set Marks as **Shape**
iii)	Drag **Year** to detail
iv)	Apply **Dual Axis**



### 3.2.4 Create Arrow Head
i)	Create new Calculated Field call **shape** and set positive or negative based on the [Direction] created earlier. 
ii)	Drag field **Shape** into both Color and change the colour to **red** and **blue**
iii)	Drag field **Shape** again to shape (mark) and change shape palette to filled - **triangle up** and **down** for **+** and **-** respectively

### 3.2.5 Remove the extra triangle
i)To remove the extra triangle, create new calculated field call **Size of Shape**
ii)Drag this new field to **Size** and this will change the shape sizes are not [Year] = 2019 and set size as 0 which making the triangle disappear. 

### 3.2.6 Complete the Arrow

i)	To change synchronize the line colour, select **line** Mark and drag **Shape** to Color. Click on **Color** and set **markers to all**. This will put the dot to better represent the starting point 2009. 
ii)	**Synchronize** the Right Y axis. 
iii)	Click on **Size** to increase the arrow line. 

### 3.2.7 Add in the % label
i)	Select Shape Mark and drag **Direction** to Label
ii)	Under label appearance edit label **<AGG(Direction)> %** to add %.
iii)	Under font click **match Mark color**


iv)	Alignment set to Center and Top
v)	Hide repeated values in the Chart by setting the Mark Label **“Never Show”**.
vi)	Remove the Right Y Axis

### 3.2.7 Title and formatting
i)	Hide all cards on the left to remove the filter/legends
ii)	Insert caption for source and X Axis
*Source: Table 5: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 - 2019 (JUNE)*
iii)	In format, add grid lines and remove row divider.


## 3.3 Create Sparklines

### 3.3.1 Create line chart as base
i)	Drag **Year** to column, and **Age group** and **LFPR %** to Rows
ii)	Edit axis to change the Range to **Independent axis ranges** for each row. So the sparklines will be more obvious.


iii)	Sort the Age group by Descending order and hide the Y axis. 
iv)	From Color **set markers** to All to show the dots.
v)	Remove the row grid lines and column dividers using format.
vi)	Change title to *Year-on-Year LFPR* to and align center.
vii)	Remove x-axis header

viii) Drag **Year** into label and set mark to label as **min/max** 
Remove all point except for bottom age group as shown.

## 3.4 Combining into Dashboard
### 3.4.1 Create new dashboard
i)	Drag **Arrow graph** to the canvas
ii)	Drag **Sparklines** to the right of arrow graph
iii)	Drag **image object** import **arrow image[custom image]** to bottom right of arrow graph as legend
iv)	And drag text objects beside the arrow and key as 2009 and 2019

### 3.4.2 Annotation, Title size and white space alignment
i) Add text objects annotation for both charts to highlight the info.

 *Older age groups show higher increase in %*  

 *Younger age groups show more fluctuations in their LFPR*  

ii) **Dashboard title** size change to **size 15**
iii) **Chart titles** change to **size 12**
iv) Add **blank objects** to align the charts. 


# 4.0 Major observations 

1)	Older age group have a higher increase in LFPR compared to the younger age group.

2)	YOY for age bands 30 and above shows gradual changes. However, for age band 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29, we can observe more fluctuations in their LFPR.
