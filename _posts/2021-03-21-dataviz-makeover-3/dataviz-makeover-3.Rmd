The original Data Visualisation is definitely confusing and have some flaws to improve for its aesthetic at Quadrant III.

| C1  | Solid color dots in the dot plot   are overlapping. As such it is challenging to visualize especially the   cluttered area where we do not know how many dots are underneath. Dot plot   has its advantage to know the exact location of each event.   |     To use a proportional symbol map with transparency and size of the   circle to represent the amount to make it clearer and easier to extract the   numbers as we do not need to count each individual dot. To add on more details   and improve clarity using Bar chart and making use of tooltips. Besides,   adding a toggleable density heatmap would retain the exact location of each   event and provide a different perspective on the concentration of   events(filterable) which in the current dot plot is hidden. Toggleable   Proportional Symbol pie chart map would also provide an overview by country   or state of the breakdown overview.  |
| C2  | The line chart doesnâ€™t start   from 0 as it may be visually misleading to the actual scale from the   overview.                                                                                                                                        | Ensure Line charts start from 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| A3  | Not color blind friendly as the   event type contains both red and green color which can be challenging to   color blind users. | Do not use Red and Green colors   in same chart.

| I1  | The dashboard is showing from   year 2015 to 2020. However, there is no filtering by years restricting user   from selecting the time frame.                        | Include Year slider filter to   allow user to dynamically select the year range                                                                                                                                                                       |
| I2  | The chart only allows filter by   one country or all and is unable to drill down by to compare by state. So,   can it be hard to compare across selected countries. | To allow drilling down to state   for both Map and line charts and filtering to allow multiselect so can be   compared across countries or between states.                                                                                            |
| I3  | No interactive coordination   between the charts. You have to select and filter/highlight the two chart   individually or using the filter panels.                  | Create highlight and filter   actions to have coordinate interactivity between the charts more engaging and   intuitively. To also include toggling of charts to allow more exploratory   options. Such as stackedbar chart with on the fly sorting.  |
| I4  | The map will re location and   zoom to the selected country. This is a good interaction to maintain.                                                                | Apart from just maintaining the   relocation of selected country. To add in interactive by allowing user to   click the country on the map as a filter to select and zoom into the   map/bar&line charts.                                             |


# 2.0 Sketch of Proposed Design

<br> ![](picture/50.png){width=100%} <br> 


1)	Map can be toggled by different views by proportional symbol map(size of circle by event type) ,
 proportional piechart map (overview of breakdown using piechart) and density heatmap to see the hotspots of overall or filter by country/event type.
2)	Tooltips have details and pie chart breakdown by country and state for comparison within and between the countries.
3)	Bar chart can show better number of event and fatalities supplement the map charts. On-the-fly sorting using set action improves the stacked bar chart to compare between the countries and state by event type easily.
4)	Able to toggle bar and line chart allows different perspective sich as trend using line chart or by total amount using stacked bar chart.
5)	Using of highlight/filter actiosn allow interactively and intuitive selection/highlighting of the charts within the dashboard.

# 4.0 Major observations 


## 1) Overview landscape of SouthEast Asia Region
From the Proportional PieChart Map, we can easily see the type of events overview in the Southsea Asia region, from 2015-2020.
In the north, we have the warring states Myanmar observed its borders having battles(red) and explosions(orange) events with protest(blue) in the central states.
 
For Thailand, in the north are mainly protest and the south with a higher concentration of battle and explosion events.
 
For the most part of Indonesia, states are protest(blue) events except Papua in the far east.
 
Philippines is mostly having events of Violence against civilians (beige color) with its south mixed with a high number of Battles and explosion events.

The number of event and fatalities have reduced from 3194 and 4202, to 1381 and 1205 from year 2015 to 2020. They are mostly contributed by Violence against civilians.

Drilling into the Philippineâ€™s states, In fact the majority of the events and fatalities happened in a few key states such as Metro Manila, Bulacan , Cebu and Lanao del Sur, with others spread across the nation as shown in the line chart.
